crowdin_sync.py
==================

Introduction
------------
This script is used to synchronize translations with Crowdin's. Also, it can handle
automatic commiting to Gerrit and pushing/downloading to/from Crowdin.

Prerequisites
-------------
crowdin-cli is required, check instructions at https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-cli#installation

Install requirements using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Executing
---------
Export the following environment variables to set the API keys and the base path.

    export CROWDIN_API_KEY=your_api_key
    export CROWDIN_BASE_PATH=your_base_path

Execute:

    ./crowdin_sync.py --branch version [--upload-sources] [--upload-translations] [--download]

Bugs
----
 - When committing fails, the reason of it cannot be determined. Often this is just when there
   are no new translations, so the script will not exit when this happens.
